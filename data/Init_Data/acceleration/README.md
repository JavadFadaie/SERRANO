## 1. Title of dataset
 Acceleration (Vibration batch data).

## 2. Name of dataset creator
IDEKO 

## 3. Description of data
Vibration data from ball screw is collected and analyzed, in order to quantify the degradation of the components that are related to axes, that is, motors, ball screw, ball nut, etc. Data is collected while the machine is performing movements.

This case is focused on the vibration signals obtained from several sensors while the machine is moving in the idle conditions.

Forward-backward movements are performed and data is collected separately for each axis. That is, independent files are collected for each of the axes. Vibration signals are collected in axial and radial directions for both axes.

This data is collected in order to monitor the health of the machine. By monitoring this kind of data, we are able to track the deterioration process of the machine, caused by the continuous use of it. Vibration data is widely used in manufacturing context for the purpose of detecting failures in the rotatory elements of machines.

The variables monitorized for each axis are the following:
- time
- Axial: vibration signal in axial direction
- Radial: vibration signal in radial direction

## 4. Source of data
Vibration data is obtained from the accelerometers that are installed in the critical parts of the ball screw. The analyzed machine is composed by two axis, and two accelerometers are installed on each axis and vibration signal in axial and radial direction is collected. Therefore, four different vibration signals can be studied.

The monitoring of these signals is done in higher sampling frequency, due to the difficulty to track these failures in usual sampling rates. These batch data are executed periodically, in order to monitor the health of the machine.

## 5. Creation date
These datasets where created on December 2022.

## 6. Format
Data is stored in csv format.
